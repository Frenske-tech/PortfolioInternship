# 4.Investigative Problem Solving

You take a critical look at your project from different perspectives, identify problems, find an effective approach and arrive at appropriate solutions.

Identify problems = Throughout all phases of the project, initially by identifying the problem/opportunity of the client, defining the main scope of the project and formulating the related research questions, and during the project by identifying newly encountered problems/challenges and formulating more in-depth or detailed research questions.

Different perspectives and effective approach = you use a variety of research strategies, methods and activities (reference: https://ictresearchmethods.nl/The_DOT_FrameworkLinks to an external site. ) in a structured way in order to find justified answers to your research questions.

Appropriate solutions = you use the results from your research to create valuable solutions and validate these with the relevant stakeholders.
