# 5.Personal Leadership

You are entrepreneurial around your projects and personal development, you pay attention to your own learning ability and keep in mind what kind of IT professional and/or what type of positions you aspire to.

Entrepreneurial = you take the lead in your own project, both planning as well as content wise.

Pay attention to your own learning ability = you can reflect on your own actions, ask and receive feedback on your actions and look for further opportunities and possibilities that flow from that feedback and that you are aware of your development as an IT professional
